The default behaviour of ifstream type stream (upon opening file) allows user to read contents from the file. if the file mode is ios::in only then reading is perform on a text file and if the file mode also includes ios::binary along with ios::in then, reading is performed in binary mode. No transformation of character take place in text mode.
